1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dup_check.git
   cd dup_check
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash

   ```
4. The executable will be available at `target/release/dup_check`

## Usage

### Command Line Options

```bash
dup_check [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -d, --directory <PATH>     Directory to scan for duplicates
  -e, --extensions <LIST>    Comma-separated list of file extensions (e.g., "jpg,png,pdf")
  -y, --yes                  Skip confirmation prompts
  -h, --help                Display help information
  -V, --version             Display version information
```

### Interactive Menu

1. **Scan New Directory**
   - Enter the path to scan
   - Choose file types to include
   - View scanning progress
   - Benefit from cached results for faster rescans

2. **Change File Types**
   - Select from predefined categories:
     - Images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, etc.)
     - Documents (pdf, doc, docx, txt, etc.)
     - Videos (mp4, avi, mkv, etc.)
     - Audio (mp3, wav, flac, etc.)
     - Archives (zip, rar, 7z, etc.)
     - Code (rs, py, js, etc.)
   - Or choose "All Files" to scan everything

3. **Show Current Results**
   - View duplicate groups
   - See file sizes and paths
   - Get total space usage statistics

4. **Delete Duplicates (Current File Types)**
   - Review duplicates before deletion
   - Confirm deletion action
   - See progress and results
   - Original files are preserved

5. **Delete ALL Duplicates**
   - Scan and delete duplicates of all file types
   - Extra confirmation required
   - Progress tracking during deletion

6. **Exit**
   - Safely exit the program

### Example Workflow

1. Start the program:
   ```bash
   dup_check
   ```

2. Choose option 1 to scan a new directory
   ```
   Please enter the directory path to scan:
   > C:\Users\YourName\Documents
   ```

3. Select file types to scan:
   ```
   Available file type categories:
   0. All Files (no extension filter)
   1. Images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, ...)
   2. Documents (pdf, doc, docx, ...)
   ...
   ```

4. Review the results:
   ```
   Duplicate files found:
   Group 1 (hash: abc123...)
     Original: file1.jpg (1.2 MB)
     Duplicate 1: file2.jpg (1.2 MB)
     ...
   ```

5. Choose to delete duplicates if desired:
   ```
   WARNING: You are about to delete 5 duplicate files, saving 6.5 MB of space.
   This action cannot be undone!
   Are you sure you want to proceed? [y/N]:
   ```

## Performance Features

- Efficient memory usage
- Optimized for modern CPUs

## Safety Features

- Original files are always preserved
- Confirmation required before deletion
- Safe file handling using Windows API
- Progress tracking and error reporting
- Minimum file size threshold (1KB)
- Maximum path length checking
- Thread-safe operations

## File Type Categories

1. **Images**
   - jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, webp

2. **Documents**
   - pdf, doc, docx, txt, rtf, odt, xlsx, xls, ppt, pptx

3. **Videos**
   - mp4, avi, mkv, mov, wmv, flv, webm

4. **Audio**
   - mp3, wav, flac, m4a, aac, ogg, wma

5. **Archives**
   - zip, rar, 7z, tar, gz, bz2, xz

6. **Code**
   - rs, py, js, html, css, cpp, c, h, java, php, rb, go, ts

## Tips

1. **Large Directories**
   - Initial scan caches results for faster subsequent scans
   - Parallel processing improves performance
   - Progress bar shows estimated time
   - Consider filtering by file type

2. **File Selection**
   - Use "All Files" option carefully
   - Consider scanning by category first
   - Review results before deletion

3. **Safe Usage**
   - Always verify duplicate groups
   - Keep backups of important files
   - Use the -y flag carefully

## Troubleshooting

1. **Long Paths**
   - Windows path length is limited to 260 characters
   - Move files closer to root if needed

2. **Access Denied**
   - Run as administrator for system folders
   - Check file permissions
   - Close programs using the files

3. **Performance**
   - First scan may be slower due to caching
   - Subsequent scans are significantly faster
   - Consider filtering by file type
   - Use SSD for better performance

4. **Cache Issues**
   - Cache is automatically maintained
   - Located in user's application data directory
   - Cleared when files are modified
